Given a board layout described by 2 single digit integers representing
letter and word multipliers, a valid word list, and the current state
of the board, this will find the optimal (highest scoring) move with
the available letters.

Use an '_' to represent a wildcard tile. Scores are appropriately
computed if a wildcard is used.

Commands:

A <row>,<col> <dir=V|H> <word> [<wildcard positions,...>]
Add a word starting at row <row> and column <col> (0-based) in the
specified direction (V=vertical, H=horizontal), optionally
identifying tiles in the word formed using wildcard tiles.
This isn't strictly required, but is needed for correct scoring
and subsequent plays that involve the wildcard tile. Wildcard
positions are specified as 0-based letter positions in <word>.

F <rack>
Find the highest scoring word that can be played with the
current board and the letters identified by <rack>.

R
Reset the board.

P
Print the current board state.

S [<game name>]
Save the current board state with the given name. If the board has
been previously saved or was loaded from an existing saved game,
the <game name> is not required as it'll be assumed to be the same.

L <game name>
Load a saved game state.
